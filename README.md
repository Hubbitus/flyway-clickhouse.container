# Flyway container image with Clickhouse support

Unfortunately there are [several pull requests](https://kb.altinity.com/altinity-kb-setup-and-maintenance/schema-migration-tools/) to bring into [flyway](https://flywaydb.org/) support of [Clickhouse](https://clickhouse.com/), but most of them stalled, unfortunately.

This repository contains attempt to build it with latest [PR#3611](https://github.com/flyway/flyway/pull/3611).
